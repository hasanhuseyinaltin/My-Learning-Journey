    <p>This text is styled with some of the text formatting. <br> The heading uses the text-align, <br> text-transform,
        and color properties. <br> The paragraph is indented, aligned, <br> and the space between characters is
        specified. <br> The underline is removed from this colored <br> "Try it Yourself" link.</p>
    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <p>Although these links might seem fine for someone with full sight, they won't work as you might expect with a
        screen reader. Remember, screen readers read the text. If a URL appears in the text, the screen reader will read
        the URL. In general, the URL does not convey meaningful information and can sound annoying. You might have
        experienced this problem if your phone has ever audibly read a text message with a URL.</p>
